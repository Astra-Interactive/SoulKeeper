# 👻 SoulKeeper

### Your items survive death. So does your progress.

SoulKeeper captures your full inventory and experience into a **glowing soul** the instant you die — persisting through lava, fire, and even the void — and waits quietly at the death spot until you return to claim it.

## ✨ Inspiration

SoulKeeper is the spiritual successor of [DeadSoulsKT](https://github.com/Astra-Interactive/DeadSoulsKT) — rebuilt from scratch with a clean multiplatform architecture, async-first design, and a strong focus on reliability. Where DeadSoulsKT laid the foundation, SoulKeeper brings production-grade persistence, rich visual feedback, and cross-platform support to the same beloved mechanic.

## 💀 How Souls Work

### Creating a soul

The moment you die, SoulKeeper silently intercepts the death event before anything hits the ground. Your **entire inventory** and a configurable portion of your **dropped XP** are captured and stored in the database as a soul — nothing is scattered across the floor.

A burst of red particles and a resonant bell signal that your soul has been born. The soul appears as a shimmering particle cloud with a floating nameplate — **"Soul of \<Your Name\>"** — right where you fell.

> Souls spawned in The End are clamped to a minimum Y so they can never sink into the void.

### Picking up a soul

Just **walk close** — no right-click, no shift, no interaction. As soon as you enter the soul's range, it detects you and begins transferring:

| Signal                            | Meaning                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 🔵 Cyan dust particles            | Soul holds XP                       |
| ⚪ White dust particles            | Soul holds items                    |
| 🔔 Beacon ambient sound           | Soul is nearby — follow the sound   |
| 🟣 Purple smoke + anvil sound     | Inventory full — items still remain |
| ✨ Bright flash + extinguish sound | Soul fully collected and gone       |

Items flow back inventory-slot by inventory-slot. If your inventory is full, **partial pickup** works: XP is absorbed, whatever fits goes in, and the soul persists with only what remains — no items are ever dropped or lost because of a full bag.

### Soul lifecycle

```
Death → [PRIVATE] ──── soul_free_after ────▶ [PUBLIC] ──── soul_fade_after ────▶ [DELETED]
           │                                      │
      Only owner                           Any player
      can collect                          can collect
```

| State          | Who can collect | Default timing                             |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 **Private** | Owner only      | Immediately after death                    |
| 🔓 **Public**  | Any player      | After `soul_free_after` (default: 2 days)  |
| 💨 **Gone**    | —               | After `soul_fade_after` (default: 14 days) |

Background workers (`FreeSoulWorker`, `DeleteSoulWorker`) run on a configurable tick cadence and advance souls through this lifecycle automatically — no cron jobs, no restarts, no admin action needed.

---

## 🗃️ Krates — Backup Storage

Every death also writes a **Krate**: a standalone YAML snapshot of the soul, saved to disk **independently of the database**.

```
plugins/SoulKeeper/
  deaths/
    <player-uuid>/
      <epoch-second>_0.yml   ← first krate
      <epoch-second>_1.yml   ← second krate (if retry occurred)
      ...
```

Krates are a last-resort safety net. Even if the SQLite database is lost, corrupted, or rolled back, an admin can restore any dead player's exact inventory from the krate file — **zero database interaction required**.

```
/soulkrate <uuid> <epoch-second> <index>
```

This reads the matching `<epoch>_<index>.yml` krate file and deposits its items directly into the requesting player's inventory. Use it when:

- A database failure occurred during a busy session
- A player was rolled back by an external tool
- Items need to be restored from a specific past death

## 🚀 Features

### 🔄 Fully non-blocking

Every heavy operation — soul creation, pickup detection, database reads/writes, background worker loops — runs on **Kotlin coroutines** dispatched to background threads via `KotlinDispatchers`. The main game thread is never touched for I/O.

### 🛡️ Safe, explicit failure paths

Database operations return `kotlin.Result<T>`. Failures are logged at the call site and skipped gracefully — they never crash the server, silently eat items, or leave souls in a broken state. Concurrent DB writes in `SoulsDaoImpl`, the pickup loop in `PickUpWorker`, and death event handling in `ForgeSoulEvents`/`BukkitSoulEvents` are each guarded by their own `Mutex`.

### 📦 Krate safety net

A file-based snapshot is written on every death independently of the database. Items cannot be lost in a catastrophic DB failure.

### 🎨 Fully customizable effects

Every particle (type, color, size, count) and every sound (ID, volume, pitch) is independently configurable per event type. Six sound cues, five particle effects — all tweakable without touching code.

### ⏳ Configurable soul lifecycle

`soul_free_after` and `soul_fade_after` are plain duration values. Set them to seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Background services poll reactively from a config `Flow` — changes reload live without a restart.

### 📈 Partial pickup

If your inventory is full when you reach a soul, XP is collected first, then as many items as fit go in. The soul survives with the remainder. Walk back once you have space — nothing is ever force-dropped.

### 🏷️ Virtual floating name tags

Floating armor-stand nameplates ("Soul of \<Player\>") are sent as **virtual entities via PacketEvents** on Bukkit — no real entities are spawned into the world, so performance is unaffected regardless of soul count.

### 🔔 Proximity soul calling

A `SoulCallWorker` tracks every online player's position. When a player enters `soul_call_radius` blocks of a soul they can collect, ambient sounds and particles begin pulsing — guiding them back even in complete darkness or deep underground.

### 🌍 End dimension safety

Souls spawned in The End are clamped to `endLocationLimitY` so they never fall below the island floor and become unreachable.

### 📑 Paginated soul browser

`/souls` lists all visible souls with owner name, coordinates, age (formatted as "X days ago"), and item/XP indicators. Admins see clickable **[FREE]** and **[TP]** buttons inline. 5 souls per page; prev/next navigation included.

### 🗄️ Versioned database migrations

`DatabaseMigrator` carries all schema migration steps. Upgrading the plugin never requires manual SQL — migrations run automatically on startup.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings live in `config.yml` inside the plugin data folder and are hot-reloadable via `/skreload`.

```yaml
# Database file path (SQLite)
database: ...

# Soul becomes publicly collectible after this duration
soul_free_after: 2d

# Soul disappears permanently after this duration
soul_fade_after: 14d

# Radius (blocks) within which a soul emits sounds/particles to guide its owner
soul_call_radius: 100

# Fraction of dropped XP stored in the soul (0.0 – 1.0)
retained_xp: 1.0

# Minimum Y for souls in The End (prevents void loss)
end_location_limit_y: 0.0

# Show floating "Soul of <player>" name tags above souls
display_soul_titles: true

# How PvP deaths are handled
# NONE        – PvP deaths create no soul
# EXP_ONLY    – soul holds XP only
# ITEMS_ONLY  – soul holds items only
# EXP_AND_ITEMS – soul holds everything (same as normal death)
pvp_behaviour: NONE
```

### 🎵 Sounds

| `soul_content_left` | `block.anvil.place`              | Inventory full, items remain |

### 🌟 Particles

Every particle effect is independently configurable with `key`, `count`, and optional `dust_options` (RGBA color + size):

| Key                 | Default color    | Trigger                          |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| `soul_items`        | White `#FFFFFF`  | Soul contains items (continuous) |
| `soul_xp`           | Cyan `#00FFFF`   | Soul contains XP (continuous)    |
| `soul_created`      | Red `#eb3437`    | Burst on soul creation           |
| `soul_gone`         | Yellow `#FFFF00` | Burst on full collection         |
| `soul_content_left` | Purple `#a103fc` | Inventory full warning           |

## 🌐 Multiplatform

SoulKeeper ships a **separate fat-jar** for each supported platform. All core logic — soul lifecycle, pickup detection, database, background workers, commands — lives in shared platform-agnostic modules. Only event wiring and item serialization are platform-specific.

| Platform           | Jar                       | Minimum version |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Paper / Spigot** | `soulkeeper-bukkit.jar`   | Paper 1.21.1    |
| **Forge**          | `soulkeeper-forge.jar`    | Forge 1.21.1    |
| **NeoForge**       | `soulkeeper-neoforge.jar` | NeoForge 1.21.1 |

Pick the jar for your platform and drop it in — the same soul data, the same commands, the same behaviour everywhere.
